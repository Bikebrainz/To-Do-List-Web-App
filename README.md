# To-Do-List-Web-AppIn this JavaScript code:

    The addTask function is called when the "Add Task" button is clicked.
    The function retrieves the value from the input field.
    It checks if the input is not empty. If it's not empty, it creates a new list item (<li>), sets its text content to the task, and appends it to the tasks-list element.
    After adding the task to the list, it clears the input field.
    If the input is empty, you can handle it as you wish, such as displaying an alert to the user.
